# C3S Reanalysis Tutorial

**PLEASE NOTE THAT THIS A DEVELOPMENT INSTANCE, THESE NOTE BOOKS ARE OFFICIALLY PUBLISHED ELSEWHERE**

This Jupyter book is a sub-module of the core C3S training material, it is published here for reviewing the
content prior to publication.

Reanalysis datasets provide comprehensive, gridded meteorological information spanning multiple decades, offering valuable insights into past weather and climate conditions. This tutorial series delves into the utilization of reanalysis data for various meteorological analyses.

## Climatology

In this tutorial we will access data from the Climate Data Store (CDS) of the Copernicus Climate Change Service (C3S), and analyse climatologies and trends in near-surface air temperature. 

The tutorial comprises the following steps:

1. Search, download and view data
2. Calculate a climate normal
3. Visualise anomalies with respect to the normal
4. Calculate monthly climatology and anomalies
5. View time series and analyse trends

## Heatwave Analysis

In September 2020, a record-breaking heatwave occured in large parts of western Europe, ([see a description here](https://climate.copernicus.eu/september-brings-record-breaking-warm-temperatures-and-low-sea-ice)). The city of Lille in northern France for example experienced its hottest day in September 2020 since records began in 1945. In this tutorial we will analyse this event with data from the Climate Data Store (CDS) of the Copernicus Climate Change Service (C3S).

The tutorial comprises the following steps:

1. Search, download and view data
2. View daily maximum 2m temperature for September 2020
3. Compare maximum temperatures with climatology

## Temperature Record

In this tutorial we will access data from the Climate Data Store (CDS) of the Copernicus Climate Change Service (C3S), and analyse air and sea surface temperatures comparing July 2023 record breaking values with climatologies. 

The tutorial comprises the following steps:

1. Search, download and view data
2. Calculate a global surface temperature climatology
3. Compute and visualise anomalies with respect to the climatology
4. View time series and rank global surface temperature records
5. Analyse North Atlantic sea surface temperature trend
